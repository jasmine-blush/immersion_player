# Immersion Player
A very simple audio player that sits in your system tray/notification area and randomly plays audio files from a selected directory.  
Has no GUI (besides for selecting a directory) and doesn't appear in the task bar (only system tray).  
Opening the Context Menu of the tray icon reveals some playback options.  

Uses [NAudio](https://github.com/naudio/NAudio) for audio playback.
